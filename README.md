# LIBRARY-DATABASE-AND-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
This project helped me learn how to design and query a real-world database using SQL. The goal is to build a structured database that tracks books, members, and loan activities. Creating a new database called library_db, ensuring the connection is active, and understanding how to organize a database for practical applications.

Library Database Management System 📚
A beginner-friendly, pure-SQL project to build a complete library management database from scratch.
Goal
Design and query a relational database that tracks:
•	Books (title, author, genre, copies, etc.)
•	Members (personal info and membership details)
•	Loans (borrowing, due dates, and returns)
Perfect for learning real-world SQL skills through a practical example.
What You'll Learn
•	Create a database and tables with proper constraints
•	Use primary keys, foreign keys, and data types effectively
•	Write SELECT queries with WHERE, JOINs, and date functions
•	Filter, sort, limit, and extract meaningful insights
•	Understand normalization and relationships (One-to-Many)
Database Schema (3 Core Tables)
SQL
books      → Stores book details
members    → Registered library users
loans      → Borrowing transactions (links books ↔ members)
15-Days Learning Phases on 5 topics
1.	Database Setup
2.	Table Creation & Schema Design
3.	Basic SELECT Queries
4.	Advanced Filtering (dates, logical operators)
5.	Sorting, DISTINCT, LIMIT/OFFSET
Ideal For
•	SQL beginners wanting hands-on practice
•	Job interview preparation
•	Building a strong portfolio project
•	Understanding how real library systems work behind the scenes
Just clone, run the SQL scripts, and start querying! No backend or app needed — 100% SQL.
⭐ Star this repo if it helped you level up your SQL! Happy querying! 🧑‍💻
